# Face-Detector
Face Detection using OpenCV and Python

You must have the Python Interpreter installed in your machine to run the apps.
"face_detector_images.py" detects faces from images stored in the faces directory while "face-detector.py" detects faces via the
webcam.
Double click "face-detector.py" app to see if your face is detected or save your image in the faces directory. -> A rectangle will pop up once a face is detected.![face](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/78599959/179696878-4ae91c10-32fe-482b-b15d-c4a2c5d1f2cc.png)
